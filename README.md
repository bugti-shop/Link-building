# 🔗 Broken Link Building SEO Case Study

This project showcases my step-by-step implementation of the **Broken Link Building strategy** to earn high-authority backlinks for two of my expired websites:  
- `mustafabugti.com`  
- `bugtishop.com`

---

## 📌 Strategy Overview

I followed the classic **Broken Link Building** approach with modern tools and filters:

1. **Selected niche-relevant authority sites** like pcmag.com  
2. Used **Ahrefs (Paid)** to identify 404 pages on those sites  
3. Extracted all backlinks pointing to those broken URLs  
4. Applied filters for **DoFollow** backlinks only  
5. Exported to PDF for outreach  
6. Manually visited each site and contacted their editorial or technical team  
7. Sent customized outreach emails using a template (no individuals, no LinkedIn outreach)
